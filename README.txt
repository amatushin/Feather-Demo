This is a sample application that uses the Aviary Photo Editor API in 
order to edit and display a photo. This application is meant to be a 
launch point for any developers who wish to edit images in their
application using Aviary. 

This run this application, add an image called "test_image.jpg" to the 
path: "/sdcard/DCIM/Camera/"

This path can, of course, be changed- the current path exists for 
purely demo purposes.
